### Quotes:
"My career in the movie business began in Hong Kong, my heart has always been tied to Asia, and it is immensely gratifying to see international recognition for Asian cinema as a whole."

"That's the magic of filmmaking, to draw the audience into an exotic world and keep them there and keep the suspense."

"As an actor, you hope to find roles that are challenging to you as an artist. Then if you are truly blessed, you will find that it also carries a message that you can impart to your audience."


### Why I Chose Michelle Yeoh?
I chose Michelle Yeoh to be the actress for this project because I can relate to her in a variety of ways. Firstly, Michelle Yeoh has starred in many Hong Kong films in addition to American films. Being Cantonese and having my family be from Hong Kong, I never really saw myself represented in American films. I still remember being very excited the first time I heard Michelle Yeoh speak in Cantonese in Crazy Rich Asians. Seeing myself represented in the American film industry has been very inspiring. In addition, having graduated from Royal Academy of Dance, Michelle Yeoh had pursued a ballet career for many years of her childhood. Similarly, throughout my childhood, I danced many years of professional ballet, and even completed the Royal Academy of Dance examination many years in a row. As a result, knowing that Michelle and I were similar in a variety of ways has made her a huge inspiration for me, making her the obvious choice for this actor profile project.
